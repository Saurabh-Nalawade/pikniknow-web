    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to PiknikNow! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect, how we use and safeguard that information, and your rights regarding your personal data. By using our website or mobile application, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information when you interact with PiknikNow:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, and profile picture.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Foreground Location:</strong> Accessed only while the app is in use. This allows us to calculate your distance from nearby posts, tag your location when creating a story, and personalize your discovery experience.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable features such as live distance calculations and location-based content tagging.</li>
        <li>Provide real-time, location-aware content discovery while you are actively using the app.</li>
        <li>Personalize the user experience and improve app functionality.</li>
        <li>Send service-related updates and notifications.</li>
        <li>Comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We want to be absolutely clear: <strong>PiknikNow does not sell, rent, trade, or share your personal data with any third party for commercial purposes—under any circumstances.</strong></p>

        <p>Your data is not shared with cloud hosting or infrastructure providers in a form that allows them to access, view, or process it. All hosting environments are securely configured, and data remains fully encrypted and accessible only by authorized systems under our direct control.</p>

        <p>In limited cases, we may use essential, privacy-compliant tools strictly for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>App performance diagnostics (e.g., crash logs)</li>
            <li>Anonymous usage analytics for internal improvements</li>
            <li>User support requests you initiate (e.g., tickets or bug reports)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These services are used in compliance with industry best practices and are fully governed by data protection agreements. Even in such cases, <strong>your identifiable personal data is never exposed, accessed, or repurposed.</strong></p>

        <p>Your trust is our priority, and we adhere strictly to a zero-data-sharing policy beyond what is technically required for secure, private operation of PiknikNow.</p>

    
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take your data security seriously. PiknikNow implements comprehensive security protocols to ensure the safety and confidentiality of your personal information. These measures include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>End-to-end encryption of sensitive data</li>
        <li>Firewall-protected infrastructure</li>
        <li>Strict access control policies and role-based permissions</li>
        <li>Secure data storage with redundancy and backup protocols</li>
        <li>Regular vulnerability assessments and security audits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have adopted industry best practices and maintain a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating potential risks. While we have taken every reasonable step to safeguard your data, it is important to note that no system can guarantee 100% security due to the inherent nature of digital communication and storage.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, we continuously review and enhance our security practices to meet the highest standards of protection and compliance.</p>


    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as needed to provide services and fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. After that, we securely delete or anonymize the data in accordance with industry best practices.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request corrections or updates to your information.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your data, under applicable conditions.</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent at any time where data processing is based on consent.</li>
        <li>Restrict or object to the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information provided below.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>PiknikNow does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from individuals under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will delete that information immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our application may contain links to external websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any third-party service they interact with.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we do, we will revise the “last updated” date and notify users where appropriate, either through in-app alerts, emails, or website banners.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data, you can reach us at:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> support@pikniknow.com<br>
       <strong>Phone:</strong> +91-9325504485</p>

    <h2>11. Location Permissions</h2>
    <p>PiknikNow requests access to your device’s location only while the app is actively in use, in order to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Help you discover nearby posts and experiences.</li>
        <li>Tag your current location when posting stories or interacting with the map.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not access or use your location when the app is running in the background. Location data is never sold and is used solely to improve your in-app experience. You may revoke location permissions at any time via your device settings; however, certain features may not function as intended without it.</p>
