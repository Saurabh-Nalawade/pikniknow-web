    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to PiknikNow! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect, how we use and safeguard that information, and your rights regarding your personal data.

                <li><strong>Background Location:</strong> Accessed when the app is not in use to continuously update your real-time distance from nearby posts and events. This allows us to deliver a seamless, location-based discovery experience, which is a core part of our application.</li>

        </li>
        
    </ul>

        <li>Comply with legal obligations and regulatory requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Your Information</h2>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as needed to provide services and fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. After that, we securely delete or anonymize the data in accordance with industry best practices.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our application may contain links to external websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any third-party service they interact with.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h2>11. Location Permissions</h2>
    <p>PiknikNow requests access to your location in two specific scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>While using the app:</strong> To help you discover nearby posts and to tag your current location when posting a story or using the map.</li>
        <li><strong>In the background:</strong> To provide live distance updates between your current location and location-based posts, even when the app is closed or running in the background. This is essential for enabling real-time proximity-based discovery, which is a core feature of our app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Location data is never sold and is used solely to improve your in-app experience. You may revoke location permissions at any time in your device settings; however, certain core features may not function as intended without this access.</p>
